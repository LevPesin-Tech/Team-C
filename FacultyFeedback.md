# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.
